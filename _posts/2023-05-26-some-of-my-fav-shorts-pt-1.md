Short movies and videos hold a special place in my heart. It's always an impressive feat of directing, editing, and writing prowess when a creator can create a compelling story while remaining concise. Here are a few of my favorite shorts that have made me laugh, cry, ponder, and curl up in horror. Hopefully, they will do the same for you. I  also made sure not to divulge any spoilers so  you can experience them fresh and without further ado. Each short can be watched on this page. Dont forget to put in your earphones, Enjoy.


#### Dear Basketball

Dear Basketball is the most intimate story on the list as Kobe Bryant chronicles his time with basketball in a single love letter. The hand-drawn visuals
 exude a childlike enthusiasm for basketball that pervades the entire film and the heartwarming score serves as a perfect companion piece to the visuals. However, the best part of this film is the writing and narration done by Kobe tinged with emotions as he reflects on the ebbs and flows of his relationship with basketball. 

#### Working Through Pain

 Batman has been a prevalent part of Hollywood undergoing many different interpretations of his story over time so it is always surprising when a creator can approach his story from a different angle. The story follows Batman/bruce as he recollects his past in the middle east. The writing is subtle, concise and leaves many things up for interpretation. The editing is slick and ladened with subtle conveyance to the underlying ideas hinted at with the dialogue. It is a beautiful portrait of a flawed human being.

#### Still Life

 Without giving anything away there is a delicate balance between the directing and editing that builds tension and comedy throughout this film. I will keep this synopsis and review short. Enjoy 

#### Volkwagen Star Wars Ad

This short film is the shortest on the list, clocking in around 1 min, and is the only silent film listed. Don't lets it size and the fact it is a commercial detour you from watching. This one is hilarious and remains a masterclass in both directing and editing. A tour de force!!

#### Mama

Mama serves as the spooky film on the list. Mama is also the only short developed into a full-feature film by acclaimed director Guillermo Deltorro. This film has smooth long shots, atmospheric sound design, elite directing, and a killer scare scene. With this much talent, it was destined for the big screen.

#### The Thing about The Johnsons

Be warned, this film is unforgettable. Once you've seen this short, you cannot unsee it. This was the film that blasted acclaimed director of Hereditary, Ari Aster, on the scene. Despite the mainstream success of his feature lengths films, this one remains his most twisted and extreme. This one will stick with you.
