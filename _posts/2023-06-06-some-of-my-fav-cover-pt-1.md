One of the most fascinating properties of classic songs from the past is their refusal not to be forgotten. One of the reasons for this resilience  despite changing music trends is renditions. No matter how far in the past these songs have been buried, creative artists can refashion classic songs and introduce them to a new generation. A Great cover feels fresh and innovative while preserving what makes the original song so resonant in the past. Here are some of my favorite covers in no particular order. All music covers can be enjoyed on this page. Links to the origional song that are being covered are provided as well.

#### So Beautiful

This cover is the definition of slick. The intro alone is perfect. The simple jazzy chords, the rhythmic drums and even simpler bass. There is something effortless about this cover. Enjoy

#### Jacob Collier Flinstones

I would be lying if I said I discovered Jacob Collier on my own. A former work colleague, who is more musically inclined than myself, was trying to impress onto me the genius of this man. At the time, I didn't fully understand it  until I saw this cover. The highs and lows of his vocal range are impressive, not to mention his fine-tuned fidelity at these ranges. However, the most outrageous part of his performance is his ability to change pitch and harmonies while  maintaining the same, popular, playful Flinstons magic throughout the song. Jacob Collier is not only a generational talent but has a technical understanding of sound that allows him to do things only he alone might be able to replicate. 

#### Aloe Blacc Billie Jean

I've always thought that the synth chords played in Billie Jean over the recognizable bassline have  been underrated. One of the most recognizable parts of Billie Jean is the bassline and the drums. The drums and the bass are the first instruments you hear until the synth chords come in later to provide flavor to the beat. This cover inverts this relationship by it being a chamber orchestra rendition. The strings instruments are put center stage while the drums are stripped and the base functions as a subtle foundation to the moody motif evoked by the violins and cello. Aloe Blacc's vocals fit snugly in between the deep lows of the double bass and the highs of the violins. Enjoy.

#### Human Nature 
*Origional Song Link: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElN_4vUvTPs)*

Human Nature is a classic song by Micheal Jackson. The themes about the childishness and ebbs and flows of human nature perfectly expressed with the chords and lyrics. The reason for these themes are revealed beautifully in this [interview](https://youtu.be/SrlPyKxdMX4). Here is joeys interpretation. 
### Joey Alexander Human Nature

This intimate cover is performed by Joey Alexander, who did this rendition at age 17! He plays up the Jazziness already tucked in the chord progression of the original while remaining playful and childish. He also doesnt overplay this melody which tends to a be a trend set by many prolific jazz pianoist. This stands, head and shoulders, above most human nature covers. It feels sincere, simple, and profound just like the original.

#### Jamie Foxx Brady Bunch

Jamie fox is one of the most talented entertainers of all time. He can impersonate, act, sing, perform stand up and much more. Some of his most memorable moments are when hes able to combine all these talents in one performance. There is no better example of this than when not only does a slowed down version of the brady bunch. He also sings the brady bunch in the style of Prince, Luther Vandross and others. This has got to go down as one of the best live performances of all time.
