I just watched "Spider-man: Across the Spider-Verse", and it's one of the best movies I have seen in a while. However, this post is not about "Spider-man: Across the Spider-Verse" but its predecessor, "Into The Spider-Verse". If you're looking for a reason to watch this movie, here are five.

## Reason 1. Art-Style

Upon viewing "Into the Spider-Verse" I was struck by how distinctive the art style felt. In retrospect, that feeling was understandable as it was the first of its kind in terms of animation style. The unique blend of hand-drawn visuals and computer graphics flavored with these vibrant colors creates a feast for the eyes. It feels like a cliche to say this, but every scene felt like a painting. However, the most impressive feat that the creators pulled off was to make the film feel like you're reading a live-motion comic in a way no other animated movie could pull off. The comic book panel-framing of scenes, written sound effects, funny captions at the side, and other creative choices all come together to make the movie feel like you're reading an amazing comic book that is coming to life before your eyes. As of now, many movies have adopted this style however no movie does it quite like "Into The Spider-Verse"

## Reason 2. Family

The art style isn't the only thing that separates "Into The Spider-Verse" from it's superhero predecessors. The writers use Miles Morale's, the protagonist, family dynamic to revisit a tired Spiderman story with a fresh point of view. It is reminiscent of "The Incredibles", another amazing animation film, in that the film can take real family problems and wrap a compelling story around them. The theme of family pervades every inch of this story. From the antagonist to the side characters, the theme of family and finding a place where you belong is done masterfully in this film. There is a brand of wholesomeness that oozes from this film that i think is sorely missing from movies today.

## Reason 3. Music

If you pressed play on the music player above, then I don't need to tell you how great the music is in the spiderverse films but i will. There are people that think great soundtracks need to be powerfull and epic, I am not among those people. While some great soundtracks have this property, it isn't essential. The most important feature of a soundtrack is it's ability to accentuate the visual storytelling that's already taking place. The score covers this aspect perfectly.The strings, electric piano and synth create this atmosphere that seeps through each frame ,adding emotional weight to intimate scenes. The origional soundtrack is also amazing filled with smooth hip hop and other urban influences.One of my favourite songs [Sunflower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApXoWvfEYVU) is part of the origional soundtrack of this movie.

## Reason 4. The Characters

The heart and soul of this film are the characters. Lets start with the main character, Miles Morales.

### Miles Morales

Miles feels like one of the most relatable protagonist in years, and it's not because he is black. He is a kid that is trying to carve out an identity of his while trying to live up to his parent's expectations which is a rarely portrayed but very relatable character trait. He also retains the kid next door feeling that made the Spiderman hero so loveable over the years. Miles Morales feels as fresh as when tobey maguire burst on the scene in 2002 as Peter Parker.

### Peter B Parker

Peter Parker is a beloved character that has been done to death in pop culture over the years. The writers cleverly embrace this fact in how the character is portrayed in the movie. In this movie, Peter has done it all and has become more jaded. His character creates an intriguing contrast between Miles who is experiencing these Spiderman moments for the first time with awe and wonder. Their relationship is comedy gold but also very heart-warming at times. The effect they have on other characters throughout the movie is palpable and masterfully done.

### Other Characters

For a film with so many characters, it's surprising how all of them have made an impression. Despite the size of the cast, most of the characters, including the ones mentioned above, change and grow as the story progresses. Nicholas Cage's spider-noir and Mile's Father were surprising stand-out characters.

## Reason 5. The Writing

The writers have done a masterful job in this film taking every story element and weaving it into a cohesive moving portrait. They are judicious with the dialogue, giving each character just enough lines and moments to shine. The writers also strike a nice balance between comedy, drama, and action effortlessly. There are also tons of subtle themes and small details that the writers decorate the plot with that enhance the story. These seeds planted by the writers also bear fruit in the sequel in unexpected and satisfying ways.

## Conclusion
"Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse" is my favorite spider-man movie and one of my favorite animated movies of all time. The story is lean, innovative, heartwarming, clever, funny, and much more. The sequel "Across the Spider-Verse" is just as good as, so check that out after watching this movie.
