Tv Shows are beginning to supplant the big screen as the primary visual-storytelling medium. Although I love movies the most, it's impossible to ignore the increasing quality of tv shows in the past decades. If you are looking for some tv shows to watch here are some of my favorites in no particular order.

## The Wire

Notable Quotes: *I don't ask where all the money comes from. I'll take any motherfucker's money if he's giving it away*

There are no perfect things in this universe but if there was The Wire would be the closest thing to it. Disregaurding the political message commonly associated with The Wire, the direction, the writing, acting and sound design are all still heads and shoulders above most if not all current tv shows despite first airing in june 2, 2002. The show is centered around baltimore innercities and the different groups that interact either directly or indirectly with that area. From the ghettoes to the police department to the public school system to public office, Wire portrays these  different realms with astonishing realism while revealing foundational flaws common to all these sectors. Despite the subject matter there is no finger-pointing just flawed people trying to survive or thrive in their own world and the consequences that follow.

## Vinland Saga

Notable Quotes: *You don't have any enemies, No one has any enemies.*

Based loosely on the discovery of America by Leif Erikson in 1000AD, Vinland Saga takes place in the twilight of the Viking era. The story follows Thorfinn, the protagonist, who is grappling with what it means to be a warrior and a man in the age of Vikings. Despite the violence in the trailer above, Vinland Saga is a nuanced critique of our obsession with violence and conquest. War, slavery, and masculinity are all themes packed within Thorfinns's gripping story of self-discovery and evolution. Vinland Saga covers a heinous part of history but it's not concerned with making moral judgments but with analyzing the human condition and its ability to evolve.


## Cosmos: A Space Time Odyssey 2014

Notable Quotes: *The cosmos is all that is, or ever was, or ever will be*

Few tv-shows can express such grand scientific ideas of varying scales with such accuracy and simplicity while still maintaining the viewers attention. Cosmos combines science and history to create a compelling and easy-to-follow story that reveals the astonishing way how nature works. In my opinion cosmos should be mandatory viewing for every human as it celebrates not only the magnificence of nature's law but the ingenuity of the human intellect to discover them.

## Nathan For You

Notable Quotes: *I graduated from one of Canada's top business schools with really good grades*

"Nathan For You" is a docu-comedy about nathan felder having small businesses perform outlandish marketing ideas is an understatement. "Nathan For You" is one of a kind. By all accounts, the companies and people involved are not staged which makes the show even more hilarious. Nathan Felder is a peculiar person whose awkward humor is unique. His personality also makes it hard to tell if he's acting or not. If you find the trailer above funny, "Nathan For You" is a show for you.

## Succession

Notable Quotes: *Life isn't knights on horseback. It's a number on a piece of paper. It's a fight for a knife in the mud*

Backstabbing, humor, drama, schemes, and affairs, Succession has it all. With Game of Thrones' conclusion, many viewers were waiting with bated breath to see what HBO would fill the shoes of its most impactful show and HBO didn't disappoint. Succession is another triumph for HBO as it takes a tired concept such as corporate America and drops a dysfunctional, almost aristocratic, family in the middle of it which makes for some of the most entertaining drama on tv right now. If you liked the political maneuvering and machinations in Game of Thrones but could've done without the debauchery, violence, and fantasy elements, then Succession is the show for you.
