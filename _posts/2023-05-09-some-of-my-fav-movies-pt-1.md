There are few things I love more than film. Over the years of watching an astounding amount of films, there are a few that I always come back to or have had a profound impact on my life. Here is a list of some of those films 

#### Magnolia

Notable Quote: *We may be through with the past but the past aint through with us*

I use to wonder often what aesthetes feel when they see a Picasso or Mona Lisa, until i saw Magnolia. Paul Thomas Anderson will go down as one of the best directors in history and for me his movie magnolia is his magnus opus. Magnolia centres around a cast of 9 seemingly unrelated characters whose stories intersect in strange ways. Cinemataogrphy, score, editing, fashion, shot composition and every bit of visual storytelling resource is used to maximal effect to breathe life into an already dynamic script . Each scene is packed with so much subtle details and handled with such care that it is hard to believe that all this came out of the mind of one man. Although the directing is oscar calibre the writing is  the heart and soul of this film. Each story beat has a creschendo effect building tension from and providing additional context to preceding scenes in the story. It comes in at about 3 hours and similar to other of PTA's works, requires a highly-developed pallete.

#### Hereditary

Notable Qoutes: *I Tried To Have A Miscarriage.*

Hereditary is one of the most terrifying movies of all time. It is also a well-directed dramatic thriller that centers around family dysfunction. The off-kilter editing throughout the film adds to the building tension throughout the movie.  I want to keep my synopsis brief. This one is better to go in blind

#### The Grand Budapest Hotel

Notable Quotes: *I've Had Older*

Okay, so I went into this film blind with a friend and I had an unforgettable experience. Grand Budapest Hotel is a unique film in almost every conceivable way. From the strikingly vibrant cinematography to the crass subject matter, this film stands in a space of its own. For a richer experience, skip the trailer and  watch the movie 


#### Steve Jobs

Notable Quotes: *Musicians play their instruments. I play the orchestra*

Steve Jobs and the stories surrounding him are the stuff of legend. Job's life and his impact have been examined from almost every angle, so surely a film chronicling his time as department manager of Macintosh and Apple CEO couldn't be that compelling? Steve Jobs, the film, is captivating but also tragic. This film's primary goal is not to be as historically accurate as possible (there's an amazing
 [documentary ](https://youtu.be/SrlPyKxdMX4) if you are looking for that) but to use as much that's known about him from public knowledge and personal stories to stitch together a mesmorizing portrait of who he could have been and spoiler-alert the movie works.

### Parasite

This film will be studied in film school for a long time. Right as the film opened, i knew i was in are in for a treat. This film won the Oscar for best film in its year, is it a mystery why? This movie works on every level. I also don't think I have ever seen a director perform a genre switch so smoothly. I can go on giving out compliments but I want to limit the possibility of spoilers. Please watch this movie.




#### It Follows
<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HkZYbOH0ujw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It Follows is yet another horror addition to this list. The movie is about a group of friends that get stalked by a ghost that functions as an std and while that sounds like every abstinence PSA ad, it's surprisingly creepy throughout the film. One of the reasons for its effectiveness at harnessing this feeling of foreboding terror throughout the film is because of the inspiration "It Follows" draws from the popular horror franchise Halloween (another one of my favorites). If you're a Halloween fan or a first-time viewer you will have a big smile throughout this film. Hopefully, you enjoy

#### Whiplash

I never thought jazz could be so panic-inducing until I saw Whiplash. This movie is so tense that you could hear a pin drop in the auditorium where i was watching the movie. JK Simmons is a respected conductor and mentor to pupil, Dameon, a drummer who wants to be the next charlie parker. What follows is the most stress-inducing film I have seen since black swan (another favorite of mine). If you like Black Swan, here is another one for you.

Punch Drunk Love is my favorite love story. This movie is charming, honest, quirky, and weird all at the same time. Adam Sandler shines in this role as an awkward guy with anger issues who is reaching out to an equally awkward and sweet lady. No matter how much I watch this movie, it always makes me smile.
